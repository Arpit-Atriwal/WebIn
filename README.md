# WebIn
•	An App that includes the WebView inside the linear layout which supports a lot of actions and views for navigations i.e., home, forward & back, close loading, reload, etc.
•	After API 24, it is quite tricky to handle the WebView because of security reasons.
•	We need to create a simple WebView layout on that note coming to the functionality part.
we’ll create WebView Client for handle the URL loading for third party app.
•	The whole assignment is just a prototype of a web browser that includes simple copy and select the link or URL and after clicking the link, out WebView contained app will open.
•	For that, we need to change the app preferences inside the android device.
•	But Android API 29, we need to do foreground services because suppose users press the home button after the link in the web browser so that link will remain active in that sense.
